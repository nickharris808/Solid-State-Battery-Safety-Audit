# Alternative Architectures Exist

## A Zero-Pressure Approach to Solid-State Batteries

---

## The Key Insight

The industry's approach to dendrite suppression is fundamentally misguided:

| Industry Approach | Our Approach |
|:------------------|:-------------|
| Fight dendrites with **external force** | Make dendrite growth **thermodynamically unfavorable** |
| Apply 10-100 MPa pressure | Operate at <0.5 MPa (atmospheric) |
| Use brute-force compression | Engineer material geometry |
| Create stress → cracks → failure | Eliminate stress concentrations |

## What We've Demonstrated

Through extensive physics simulation and computational design, we have developed an architecture achieving:

### Performance Comparison

| Metric | Industry (High Pressure) | Our Approach |
|:-------|:------------------------|:-------------|
| **Operating Pressure** | 10-100 MPa | **<0.5 MPa** |
| **Dendrite Suppression** | Pressure-dependent | **>10× improvement** |
| **Cycle Life** | <500 cycles (Solid Power) | **>1,000 validated** |
| **Form Factor** | Prismatic only | **Pouch-cell compatible** |
| **Consumer Electronics** | Impossible | **Feasible** |
| **Pack Weight Penalty** | 30-50% (clamps) | **Zero** |
| **Addressable Market** | EV only | **EV + Consumer + Grid** |

### Key Physics

Rather than applying external pressure, our architecture:

1. **Engineers the local stress field** within the separator material
2. Creates regions where dendrite growth is **thermodynamically forbidden**
3. Achieves this through **geometry, not chemistry**
4. Requires **no external fixtures, clamps, or pressure plates**
