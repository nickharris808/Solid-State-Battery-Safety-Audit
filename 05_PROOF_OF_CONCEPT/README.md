# Proof of Concept: Alternative Architecture

## Real Simulation Results

The following images are direct outputs from our physics simulations, demonstrating that alternative approaches to dendrite suppression exist.

## Dendrite Growth Comparison

### The Problem: Uncontrolled Dendrite Growth

![Dendrite Comparison](dendrite_comparison.png)

*Phase-field simulation showing dendrite morphology under different conditions. Left: baseline (uniform separator). Right: alternative architecture with localized stress fields.*

**Key Observation:** In conventional solid separators, dendrites propagate freely along grain boundaries and defects.

## Dendrite Arrest Mechanism

### The Solution: Thermodynamic Growth Arrest

![Dendrite Arrested](dendrite_arrested.png)

*Simulation output showing dendrite growth arrested at partial penetration depth.*

**Key Observation:** Using architected geometries that create strain-energy gradients, dendrite growth can be halted before catastrophic penetration.

**Suppression Factor:** >10× improvement over baseline

## Alternative Architecture

### No External Pressure Required

*Render of alternative separator architecture. This geometry achieves dendrite suppression without external clamping pressure.*

**Operating Pressure:** <0.5 MPa (vs. 10-100 MPa industry standard)
