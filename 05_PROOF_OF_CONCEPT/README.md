# Proof of Concept: Alternative Architecture

## Real Simulation Results

The following animations are direct outputs from our physics simulations, demonstrating that alternative approaches to dendrite suppression exist.

## 1. Mechanical Suppression Mechanism

![Mechanical Suppression](mechanics_demo.gif)

*3D Simulation: The lattice structure (grey) absorbs and redistributes mechanical stress, preventing the localization that causes ceramic fracture.*

**Key Observation:** Using architected geometries that create strain-energy gradients, dendrite growth can be halted before catastrophic penetration.

## 2. Generative Design Evolution

![Optimization Evolution](generative_design.gif)

*Evolution of the "Stiffness Trap" geometry. The algorithm optimizes material distribution to maximize dendrite blocking potential while maintaining ionic conductivity.*

**Operating Pressure:** <0.5 MPa (vs. 10-100 MPa industry standard)
