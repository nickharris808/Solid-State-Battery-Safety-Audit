# Proof of Concept: Alternative Architecture

## Real Simulation Results

The following images are direct outputs from our `battery_moonshot` physics engine, demonstrating that alternative approaches to dendrite suppression exist.

## 1. High-Resolution Dendrite Simulation

![Dendrite Simulation](dendrite_simulation.png)

*High-fidelity Phase-Field simulation of dendrite morphology. The Genesis architecture effectively arrests tip propagation, preventing short circuits.*

**Key Observation:** Thermodynamic suppression allows for safe operation without external clamping pressure.

## 2. Architecture Comparison (3D Render)

### Competitor Failure (Standard Ceramic)
![Competitor Failure](competitor_failure.png)
*Standard ceramic separators suffer from brittle fracture under local stress.*

### Genesis Stability (Architected Lattice)
![Genesis Stable](architecture_stable.png)
*Optimized lattice maintains integrity by distributing stress loads.*

**Operating Pressure:** <0.5 MPa (vs. 10-100 MPa industry standard)
